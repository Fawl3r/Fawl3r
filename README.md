## üîí **Important Note for Recruiters & Collaborators**

> **Most of my production-level projects are in private repositories for IP and business reasons** (AI models, Web3 applications, trading bots, enterprise solutions, etc.). 

**Public repositories here are curated showcases and demos** intended to give recruiters and potential collaborators a sense of my work quality, coding standards, and technical capabilities.

**If you'd like to review deeper code samples or discuss specific projects**, I can provide private access upon request during the interview process.
